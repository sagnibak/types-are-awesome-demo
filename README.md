# Types are Awesome Talk Demo

This is code to accompany my talk
[types are awesome](https://hackmd.io/@JlKICFvcQ1OvSlcQCj-4Aw/types-are-awesome#/).
This is some Rust code where I first implement Peano numerals using the Rust
type system, and then implement a `List<T, N>` type which has length known at
compile time. The Peano numeral code is heavily inspired by
[peano.rs](https://github.com/paholg/peano).
